AutoAudioSwitcher
=============

Similarly to AudioSwitcher, this program is used to quickly change the default audio device.

The main difference is that this tool will swap the default audio device to the next one in the list each time it is executed. I suggest using this program in conjunction with AutoHotKey (or similar) so that you can swap your default audio device on the fly.

Note: This program still requires access to the AudioEndPointController executable (included).
